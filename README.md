# MRI-based Brain Tumor Detection Using CNN  

This repository contains a deep learning-based project focused on detecting and classifying brain tumors from MRI images. Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), the project aims to provide accurate and reliable predictions to assist in medical diagnoses.  

## Features  
- **Deep Learning Model:** Implements CNNs for efficient tumor detection.  
- **Dataset:** Preprocessed MRI images for training and testing.  
- **Website Integration:** A user-friendly web interface for image uploads and predictions.  
- **Comprehensive Pipeline:** Includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment.  

## Dataset  
The dataset used for this project is available on Kaggle:  
[Brain Tumor Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/code/samikshasatpute/project-100-epoch)  

## Key Highlights  
- **Model Training:** The model is trained for 100 epochs to ensure high accuracy.  
- **Performance Metrics:** Evaluates precision, recall, F1 score, and overall accuracy.  
- **User Accessibility:** The website allows users to upload MRI images and receive predictions seamlessly.
